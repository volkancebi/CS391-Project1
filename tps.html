                  Gears of War is a 2006 third-person shooter video game, the first installment of the Gears of War series. It was developed by Epic Games and published by 
                  Microsoft Game Studios, initially as an exclusive title for the Xbox 360 in November 2006, before a Microsoft Windows version of the game, developed in 
                  conjunction with People Can Fly, was released in 2007. The game's main story, which can be played in single or co-operative play, focuses on a squad of troops 
                  who assist in completing a desperate, last-ditch attempt to end a war against a genocidal subterranean enemy, the Locust, and save the remaining human inhabitants 
                  of their planet Sera. The game's multiplayer mode allows up to eight players to control characters from one of the two factions in a variety of online game modes. 
                  Gameplay features players using cover and strategic fire in order to win battles.

                    The Last of Us is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. Players control Joel, a smuggler tasked with 
                    escorting a teenage girl, Ellie, across a post-apocalyptic United States. The Last of Us is played from a third-person perspective. Players use firearms and improvised 
                    weapons, and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated fungus in the genus Cordyceps. In the online multiplayer 
                    mode, up to eight players engage in cooperative and competitive gameplay.

                    Development of The Last of Us began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. For the first time in the 
                    company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, the other half developed The Last of Us. 
                    The relationship between Joel and Ellie became the focus, with all other elements developed around it. Actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson portrayed Joel 
                    and Ellie respectively through voice and motion capture, and assisted creative director Neil Druckmann with the development of the characters and story. 
                    The original score was composed and performed by Gustavo Santaolalla.

                    God of War[a] is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE). Released worldwide on April 20,
                    2018, for the PlayStation 4 (PS4), it is the eighth installment in the God of War series, the eighth chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's God of War III. 
                    Unlike previous games, which were loosely based on Greek mythology, this installment is rooted in Norse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient 
                    Scandinavia in the realm of Midgard. For the first time in the series, there are two protagonists: Kratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only 
                    playable character, and his young son Atreus. Following the death of Kratos' second wife and Atreus' mother, they journey to fulfill her request that her ashes 
                    be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms. Kratos keeps his troubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his divine nature. Along their journey, 
                    they encounter monsters and gods of the Norse world.

                    od of War received universal acclaim for its story, world design, art direction, music, graphics, combat system, and characters, in particular the dynamic 
                    between Kratos and Atreus. Many reviewers felt it had successfully revitalized the series without losing the core identity of its predecessors. It received 
                    a number of perfect review scores, tying it with the original God of War (2005) as the highest-rated game in the series, as well as one of the highest-rated 
                    PlayStation 4 games on the review aggregator Metacritic. Among other awards and nominations, God of War was awarded Game of the Year by numerous media outlets 
                    and award shows. The game performed well commercially, selling over five million copies within a month of its release and over 10 million by May 2019, making 
                    it one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 games as well as the best-selling game in the series. A novelization was released in August 2018, followed by a prequel 
                    comic series published from November 2018 to February 2019. An untitled sequel is currently in development, scheduled to be released in 2021 for the PlayStation 5.

                    Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a third-person shooter video game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Rockstar Games in October 2003. 
                    It is the sequel to Max Payne (2001) and the second game in the Max Payne series. Max Payne 2 continues the story of the titular character, a detective for 
                    the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and former vigilante, as he is reunited with contract killer Mona Sax and must work with her to resolve a conspiracy 
                    full of death and betrayal.

                    Max Payne 2 received highly positive reviews from critics, with praise focused on its action and story, while criticism targeted its short length. Despite the 
                    positive reception, the game sold poorly, leading Rockstar Games' parent company Take-Two Interactive to cite Max Payne 2's sales as a cause for the company's 
                    reforecast finances of 2004. Max Payne 2 received several industry awards, including Outstanding Art Direction at the Golden Satellite Awards 2004, and Editors' 
                    Choice Awards from GamePro, IGN, and GameSpy. A sequel, Max Payne 3, was released in 2012.
